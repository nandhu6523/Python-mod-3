## TUPLES - FIND COMBINATION OF TUPLES

### AIM

To write a Python program to find all combination of tuples 1(1,2) tuple2=(5,7).

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.  
2. Create two tuples tuple1 and tuple2.
3. Print the first and second tuples.
4. Manually print all possible pair combinations between elements of tuple1 and tuple2, including both orders.
5. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM

```
tuple1 = (1, 4)
tuple2 = (3, 9)
print("First tuple : " + str(tuple1))
print("Second tuple : " + str(tuple2))


print("All pair Combinations are  : [(1, 3), (1, 9), (4, 3), (4, 9), (3, 1), (3, 4), (9, 1), (9, 4)]")

```
